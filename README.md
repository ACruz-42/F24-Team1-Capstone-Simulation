# F24-Team1-Capstone-Simulation
A Godot-based simulation for the TNTech F24 Team 1 Capstone IEEE SECON Hardware competition robot.


# Purpose:
1. This simulation aims to assist in the implementation of A-Star, especially with regards to the size of the robot with respect to the game field and to the fact that the robot's roller mechanism only functions in one direction.
2. This simulation aims to determine what a theoretical "best case" average time is for the robot. That is to say, the average time where the robot accelerates quickly, does not malfunction, and chooses a relatively efficient path through the field.
